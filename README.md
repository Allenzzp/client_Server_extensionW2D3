# Origin
In week2 day3, I learned how to build a server and multiple clients, and make them talk to each other and the server can spread message received from one client to other clinets.

However, I felt not familiar with the net and readline modules, so I decided to rewrite this server/client project and even add more features.

## New Features
- [x] Both clients & server support readline
- [x] Client can talkt with each other by using talk

- [x] Server can send messages to a specific client

- [x] Clinet will always receive messages and display them on the right side
- [x] Client can set up a username

## What Next?
- [ ] Allow more than 2 clients talk together
- [ ] Server can send messages to more than 1 clients but not all of clients
